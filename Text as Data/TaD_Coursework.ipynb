The reason for this is that you have an instant blink with no cast time, meaning you can dodge their important skillshots quickly (Lux snare, Brand pillar or Q/ Vel'koz knock up, Xerath stun) and go in on them when they don't have their CC ability. Your main job is to be an assassin so it's better if you're against someone who's really squishy, instead of someone like Swain mid for example.\\n\\nI don't play Talon that much, but some simple tips are:\\n\\n* Your Q is an auto reset. Utilize that fact for the maximum damage. As a result, your combo should be something like: E > Auto > Q > W > R while throwing an ignite in there somewhere.\\n* Your ultimate gives movement speed. Just keep this in mind.\\n* If you get a Hydra, there is a trick you can do with gromp. By standing next to the wall where the Gromp is, you can use the Hydra active to make it aggro onto you and auto you over the wall. This gives you vision of the gromp and you can jump over with your E onto the gromp and escape (or chase).

When you're fighting a Handlock you know that if you bring them too low, they're going to drop Moltens, taunt up, and maybe even toss in a Healbot to add insult to injury.  So instead you bring them to a certain point and burn them out in one turn.\\n\\nThe same applies to Reno, except there's no specific number to work around and you don't need to stop attacking face.  You just don't want to blow any kind of burst damage until you can kill them in one turn, especially in a deck with finite and specific damage.\\n\\nNow, some decks just don't have any burst either due to class cards or lack of room for them.  The way to fight Reno with one of these decks is to make it so Reno won't save them.  For instance, as Flood Zoo you can lay out a board full of minions, Reliquary Seekers, and top it off with Loatheb.  Now it doesn't really matter if he drops Reno or not, it didn't do anything about your winning board state.\\n\\nThat said, if you're playing Oil Rogue, you should easily be able to build up ~15 damage of burst in hand.  Oil Rogue is particularly favored against most variants of Paladin since healing doesn't prevent burst, only armor does, and Rogue has many answers to Silver Hand Recruits.  I can't imagine this changes against Reno Paladin when played correctly.\\n\\nThe bottom line is, a Reno deck seeks to win through either value or fatigue.  Rogue can't win either of these games.  You have to take control and make the game about tempo, because if you start making anti tempo plays, you hand the advantage back to your Reno opponent.\",\n",

       " \"For a long time, there have been 3 dominant Arena classes: **Rogue, Mage and Paladin.** Now, win statistics may vary per person so obviously this doesn't apply to everyone, but in general I think people will agree with this. \\nThe weekly updated statistics posts of the top arena streamers back this up as well [as you can see here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jck4WkEvaKWE0Iw9RrttLHoFO3KEMG6In6XS1okzmx4/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1595896034) (credit goes to /u/sexting_shakespeare)\\n\\nAs you can see on the spreadsheet doc, since the release of LoE (Nov. 12th), Rogue, Mage and Paladin not only have been the most played classes by these streamers, but they have the highest average winrate of 7.47, 7.11 and 7.00 respectively. Further down the list Druid averages 6.82, Warlock 6.46, Shaman 6.30, Priest 6.23, Warrior 6.11 and Hunter 6.04. \\n\\nIn my experience, Mage and Rogue have been top tier arena classes since Hearthstone's release. Other classes have been there at some point, but have fallen down gradually or significantly after expansions and adventures. For example, back in the days, Warrior and Shaman were pretty solid! Paladin was considered to be a pretty weak arena class at some point. But since the release of TgT Paladin has gotten better and better. In TgT Paladin got Seal of Champions, Argent Lance and Murloc Knight. LoE gave them Keeper of Uldaman. \\n\\nSo depending on whether you want to just have fun or play to win in Arena (which often goes hand in hand), you'll pick a class accordingly. I myself and I think a lot of arena players who read this, have experienced picking and facing a lot of Rogues, Mages and Paladins in arena for quite some time now. Getting as far as possible and receiving those shiny arena rewards after, makes Arena fun for me. Therefore, I will pick Rogue, Mage or Paladin whenever I can (and so do a lot of others). Druid hangs in there too. \\n\\nI think this is a problem. Over half of the Arena classes statistically should *not* be picked, if you want to win the most games. The difference between winrates maybe doesn't seem that high if you look at the spreadsheet numbers, but in reality it means a lot to constantly win less games. Also, when playing for example Shaman or Priest, you feel so helpless playing against these Rogues, Mages and Paladins over and over again and rarely facing a Warrior. \\n\\nSo when Blizzard introduced A New Way To Play, they stated that a couple cards from the Classic and Basic set were being looked at (balancing wise). They also made clear Arena is not affected by the new Standard format, as Arena will be using all the cards, thus being in the Wild format.\\n\\nWe know that the latest released Hearthstone cards get offered more than other cards (percentage wise), so it's entirely possible that the new expansion will (drastically) change things (because new cards have a greater chance to affect the Arena meta because they get offered more). On the other hand, Rogue and Mage have been top tier Arena classes for such a long time and didn't really get affected negatively by later card releases (you could even argue that Rogue and Mage have benefited from them which added to their power). \\n\\nDo you guys share these concerns? Are you confident this next expansion will make for a better, more balanced Arena experience, with more variety in class picks? Please discuss in the comments. Thanks for reading!\\n\\nEdit: formatting\",\n",
